  {% pattern cards/card-image-right heading="Jolie Pattisery" text="The first step of this eCommerce website was called Jolie Pattisery. Jolie Pattisery had a weaker logo with a colour palette that was not very appealing. Certain parts of it were alright but overall it needed to be redone. The original version of the website can be seen at (flamboyant-hypatia-1bd01a.netlify.com/)" image="/images/jolie.jpg"%}

<div>
  {% pattern cards/card-image-left heading="The Rebrand" text="The first step of redoing Jolie Pattisery was changing the store name. By having a french name for the company, some users didn't know how to say it and some that didn't even know what it meant. The name of the company was changed to Tasty Treats to appeal more to it's target audience and with the name change came the new logo. Another thing that was heavily changed through the redo was the colour palette. The dark and very pink colour palette was changed to happier lighter colours that go better with the products they sell." image="/images/tasty-treat.jpg"%}

<div>
  {% pattern cards/card-image-right heading="The Website" text="The new website was done as an interactive mockup that could be presented to the client to be approved before continuing with coding. The new website is modernized and more easy to use. It also has an improved mobile view as a lot of online shopping is done for a smartphone. This is one of the major reasons why the website had to be redone. The Previous version of the website did not work well in mobile." image="/images/tasty.jpg"%}
