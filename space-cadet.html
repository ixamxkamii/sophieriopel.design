  {% pattern cards/card-project-about image="/images/saturn-chocolate.png" alt="Three Yellow Dots" intro="Space Cadet Edibles is a fictional company that I created. This company specializes in making THC infused foods." info="For this project I was tasked with inventing a fictional food company. I then had to come up with a product line and design it's packaging. The product line I developped are small THC infused chocolates that are inspired by planets within our solar system. The package I started with was for Saturn." %}

  {% pattern cards/card-image-left heading="The Product" text="When deciding what kind of company I wanted to create for this project, I looked at what was new in the market. Infusing THC into food had just become legalized in Canada which made it brand new to the market. This presented tons of new opportunities." image="/images/baking.jpg"%}

  {% pattern cards/card-image-right heading="The Brand" text="Since Canada has only recently legalized edibles, there aren’t any studies done for what kind of people buy edibles. Due to this, I designed the brand to apeal to the demographic for cannabis.
Research shows that more then half of cannabis consumers are between the ages of 21-39 and more then half are male. I also wanted this edibles company to have a theme. Taking the demographic into consideration, I decided to make the campany space themed and name it Space Cadet Edibles." image="/images/demographic-cannabis.jpg"%}

  {% pattern cards/card-image-left heading="The Logo" text="When thinking of ideas for Space Cadet Edibles logo, I was looking at images to inspired me when I cam accross a picture of a cannabis leaf. I realized the top part of the leaf was the same shape as the tip of a rocket. I immediately started sketching and coming up with different variations." image="/images/leaf-rocket.jpg"%}

In the first stage of logos (1), I found the smoke coming from the rocket to flat. In the second stage of the logo (2), I made the smoke more fluffy and cloud liked. Both version were presented to a group of designers to discuss which would be more effective and the second version was chosen." image="/images/space-cadet-logo-card.jpg"%}
