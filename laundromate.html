First we had to choose our primary subject which was; Self-Serve Laundry. We then conducted a study to learn our target aundience laundry routine and it's struggles." %}

  {% pattern cards/card-image-right heading="Research" text="The first step of our assignment was to do some background research on our project. Through this, we learned that there weren't many self-serve laundry apps, which we found odd since the market generates roughly $5 billion in gross revenue annually in the United States. After this, we continued to collect data about this subject by interviewing some of our target audience about their needs and frustrations about self-serve laundry." image="/images/laundromate-research.jpg"%}

<div>
  {% pattern cards/card-image-left heading="Interviews" text="During the interviews, participants were asked 9 questions. We asked participants things like, what concerns they had regarding using self-serve laundry services and factors that would significantly improve their experience. The main concerns that came up were about theft. They felt like there weren't any steps taken in preventing theft. Participants also expressed their struggles with the availability of washing machines. This indicated to us that our app would have to solve those concerns." image="/images/interview.jpg"%}
</div>

<div>
  {% pattern cards/card-image-right heading="The Features" text="With the answers given to us by our participants, we had a pretty clear list of problems that need to be solved. One of the things we solved was availability. We achieved this by giving users the ability to see if there are any machines available and reserve an available machine to lock it until the user gets to the laundry facility. To solve the issue of theft, we added a locking mechanism to the machine that would keep the machine locked even after the cycle is over. It can only be unlocked by the users with the machine reserved or with an emergency button." image="/images/features.jpg"%}

  {% pattern cards/card-image-left heading="The Product" text="The smart product created to work in partnership with the app is a 2in1 washer/dryer that is connected to smartphones using the internet. The intention of this product is that apartment buildings and college/university residences would purchase the products for their shared laundry facility. These smart products could increase their revenue coming from the laundry facility since more residents would be inclined to use it since it solves their main concerns." image="/images/laundromate-product.jpg" %}
