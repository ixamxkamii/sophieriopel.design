Sophie Riopel is a Web/App Developer with of love of UI/UX.
I absolutely love online shopping. The ease of being able to get absolutely anything even if it isn't available near me. As an avid online shopper I come across a lot of awful websites and shopping apps. When a eCommerce website is hard to navigate, I am way less likely to buy from them. I often think about how there's a really great product on a website and I can't even figure out how to purchase it then I get frustrated. This inspires me to want to create shopping websites and apps that are easy to use and get users excited about their upcoming package instead of fuming at a poorly made website.
