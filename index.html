The idea of finding cool products online with ease blows my mind. When an eCommerce website is too hard to navigate through, I immediately start thinking of why it's not working and how to fix it. The idea that there are awesome products online but people struggle with getting to them, breaks my soul." text-3="I spend way too much time thinking about other people and finding solutions for them. That's when I realized that I wanted to design cool websites and apps to help users get excited about their upcoming packages." %}
