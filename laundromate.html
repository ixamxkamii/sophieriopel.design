  <h5 class="island push-0">What problems did we solve with LaundroMate?</h5>

<div class="pad-b-1-4 bg-grey">
  {% pattern cards/card-project-about-xs image="/images/resolve-1.png" alt="Reservation icon" intro="Reservation" info="During our study we learned that users were tired of bringing their laundry to the laundry facility when sometimes there's no washer available. We solved this by allowing LaundroMate users to reserve a washing machine from their phone so that they would know the washer availability without leaving their home." %}

<div class="pad-b-1-4 bg-grey">
  {% pattern cards/card-project-about-xs image="/images/resolve-2.png" alt="Reminder List icon" intro="Reminder List" info="During our study we learned that users often forget to bring something with them when going to the laundry facility (ex. laundry detergent). We made an effort to help users by showing a reminder list after they reserve a machine." %}

<div class="pad-b-1-4 bg-grey">
  {% pattern cards/card-project-about-xs image="/images/resolve-3.png" alt="Payment Method icon" intro="Payment Method" info="During our study we learned that users were annoyed about the last of payment options at shared laundry facilities. Machines often only accept one kind of payment such as coins, which can be heavy and annoying to find or a reloadable laundry card which can be lost and can only be loaded in certain increments. We solved this buy allowing users to pay for their laundry right through the app as an in-app purchase were users can select which type of payment they would like to use." %}

  {% pattern cards/card-project-about-xs image="/images/resolve-4.png" alt="Theft Prevention icon" intro="Theft Prevention" info="During our study we learned that users are scared their items will be stolen or taken out of the washing machine by someone else. Because of this, designed the washing machines to be locked unless unlocked by the user on the app." %}

<div class="pad-b-1-4 bg-grey">
  {% pattern cards/card-project-about-xs image="/images/resolve-5.png" alt="Notification icon" intro="Notifications" info="During our study we learned that users used different ways of knowing their laundry was ready such as timers or simply going to check. We wanted to make this easier for users, so we connected the timer to the app and now users will receive a notification to let them know when their laundry is ready." %}
