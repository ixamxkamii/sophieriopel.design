I was tasked with creating a logo, a poster including all pertinent information about the event, 2 web banner advertisements (vertical banner 240x400 px and leader board 728x90 px), a save-the-date emailer (with interactivity), as well as a feather banner." %}

  {% pattern cards/card-project-about image="/images/eco-font.png" alt="Farray and Futura PT" intro="Font Choice" info="For the font I wanted to use something clean and modern. For the wordmark on the logo, I used Farray because of how big and bold it is. I also liked how the edges of the characters are rounded instead of angular since it makes it seem softer. Unfortunately, the W of Farray was pointed so I had to round them it manually. I went with Futura PT for the body copy since it has a similar look to Farry but is easier to read." %}

  {% pattern cards/card-project-about image="/images/eco-colours.png" alt="Colour Palette" intro="Colour Choices" info="I chose bright but natural colours to keep the on brand but eye catching.

  {% pattern cards/card-project-about-s image="/images/eco-sketch.png" alt="Logo icon sketch" intro="Logo Concepts" info="Since this event is all about the environment, I wanted to incorporate different elements of nature. While sketching, I was thinking about different more environmentally friendly ways to make energy. This inspired the sun on the top left for solar power, wind on the bottom left for wind turbines and waves on the bottom right for hydro dams. After this, I felt like I was missing something green since green is often associated with nature." %}

  {% pattern cards/card-project-about image="/images/eco-logo.png" alt="Leaf icon" intro="Logo Refinements" info="When I started vectorizing the logo, I realized I needed something around the icons. I decided to set them up in checker board type boxes using bright colours to attract attention. I mimicked the checker board look on the wordmark as well by setting the colours the same way on the type." %}
