They reached out to the Graphic Design students of Algonquin College to help them figure out why this wasn't working and what would be a better solution then the system in place." %}

Through our research report, we read publications about what symbols other cities and countries were using. <br> <br>We learned that there was a symbol used widely in other coutries called the R10-22. We went on to explore why this symbol was so successfull in being used and recognized by cyclists. We also ran a survey asking 100 cyclists in the Ottawa what they thought about the current Three Yellow Dots symbol. <br><br> The majority of participants answered that they do not believe the symbol is effictive in its intent. Most of them revealed they learned about the symbol through other cyclists and would not have understood it otherwise. Another big thing to consider was that many cyclists were skeptical that the induction loops were even working since there was no feedback given to cyclists to indicate that it was activated.If you would like to read more about what we learned, read the research report in the link below." link="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UyUKjtalmBLX2CYuHLpW_YEf7mciBET45yEp2kkzzgc/edit?usp=sharing" link-name="Full Research Report" %}

We knew that incorporating the colour green onto our pavement marking would help cyclists know it's intended for them. Another important thing to consider was the need for a bike somewhere on the symbol. Without using a bike anywhere on the symbol, it's hard to know it's intended for cyclists." %}

The brackets easily communicated to cyclists where they should wait.<br><br> They liked the second concect for similar reasons. The added advantage to the second concept was that it is very similar to the R10-22 sign that is used in other countries and had mesurable success." %}
