  {% pattern cards/card-image-right heading="The Size" text="The size for the bus passes was set to the size of a business card. I decided to make them a little different by making them portrait since it never been done that way in their history. This would make the new bus passes exciting for the public transportation users." image="/images/bus-sizes.jpg"%}

  {% pattern cards/card-image-left heading="The Concept" text="Timmins Transit is the only form of public transportation in this Northern Ontario town. Because of this, I thought to incorporate something that symbolizes Timmins within its design. One recongnizable symbol from this town is the mine shaft. I decided that the mineshaft had to be visible on the card. The mine shaft can be seen from one of Timmins' main roads across a small lake. This would be the main scene for my graphics on the bus pass. I also wanted to add the Timmins Transit bus in the scene." image="/images/bus-shaft.jpg"%}

<div>
  {% pattern cards/card-image-right heading="Types of Passes" text="The type of bus passes they offer are: Adult, Student and Discounted. This is a very important component of the card since it determines it price and who is allowed to have what type of card. Since the card is simply cardstock and not electronic, bus drivers have to inspect the bus passes visually as customers get on the bus. This means they have to easily identify what kind of pass is which. I acheived this with using the letters A, S and D to identify each type." image="/images/bus-sketch.jpg"%}
